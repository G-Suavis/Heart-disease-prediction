# Heart-disease-prediction
This project uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data.
Steps to build machine learning models:
- Preprocess the data.
- Build and evaluate predictive models.
- Review and interpret the results for insights into heart disease prediction.
